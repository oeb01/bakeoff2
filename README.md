# bakeoff2
the original BakeoffTwo.pde: A simple application that displays a destination square (in red) and a logo square (in grey). You can think of the destination square as a location in your mind where you want to try putting your logo. Destination squares have a random X/Y position, a random rotation, and a random scale. 

the final Prototype3.pde: A multi-dimensional input method for translating, rotating, and scaling the logo square onto the destinations as quickly and accurately as possible! (The code allows a tiny bit of error, but not a lot.)

Through an iterative design process - ideate, prototype, evaluate, refine, and repeat, our team came up with the final prototype.

Some rules when creating the application:
- all positions, rotations, and scales must be equally accessible. For example, 11.4° should be just as easy to create as 45°.
- no bias towards the destination square in any way
